      We're *excited* to use this project to make visual the impact of a swelling new force on the American landscape. There are patriots working in this country today whose commitment to the freedom of the nation is exhibited in their fierce loyalty to its citizens, to their nutrition, their water, their open space, their health and their independence. Farmers have been here all along, but in this time especially of high energy costs, sinking dollar, and the changing climate--local food production has become a key puzzle piece, and with the current agricultural community reaching retirement age, recruitment has become a critical motive. 
      
      America has always respected its farmers ideologically, but the financial and social rewards have not always followed. The time has come for us to embrace farming and its practitioners--to recognize their service, to praise them, and to pay them a living wage. The time has come for the agricultural arts, so valued by our forefathers, to inspire the best, brightest and most dedicated young people to enter the field. Farming is hard work, it is good work, it is bold work. Farming means nurturing the interface of humanity and ecology, cherishing that delicate, complex and fragrant soil. Bringing forth food, life and a sustained well being for this country.

      We challenge the eaters, thinkers, mothers, markets and policy makers of this country-- to support the young farmers. We challenge the ecologists, humanists, activists, pacifists and survivalists to join in this movement. We vote with our fork, we vote with our vote, let us vote with our lives-- and restore agriculture, that delicious foundation of our human society. It is hard work, and we can only do it together.

      This map is a way for us to feel our own numbers, and connect with nearby farmers as well as nearby markets/media.
      
      It helps to visualize the force, the surge, the irresistible fleet of citizen farmers- the merry coalition of constructive kismet.
      
      The website allows young farmers to fill out relevant details about their farming operation, their history farming, their future farming vision. Its a chance for us to raise our voices on behalf of  American agriculture.

      Journalists from national and local media will be able to access profiles of young farmers and get in contact with these rock star farmers
      
      The survey questions will generate useable demographic information about the obstacles for young farmers, the feasibility of various land-tenure options, and the potential rural economic development impact of a surge in new farmers.

      *Young Farmers, a call to arms!*

      Coast to coast, thousands of people are inspired to dig in and grow food! Yet access to the land, capital, market savvy, and skills requires for successful farming is available only to a dauntless few.  Those few are brave, strong, and delightful advocates of the purposeful life, but it will take more than a few to reclaim a food system of industrial monocultures, labor abuse, and toxic factory conditions. This is the injustice our movement seeks to repair. 

      Indeed, it will take the muscle and heart of a large-scale, young-farmers movement: thousands upon thousands of hands on the land -- the hands of women and immigrants, the hands of fourth-generation farm kids, the hands of college graduates and former farmworkers-turned-farmers. It will take thousands of new growers of fruits, nuts, vegetables, grains, dairy, and livestock to transform the landscape of sprawling development and corporate control into a dignified, livable, and culturally rich mosaic of ecological farming.

      !/images/GH.goat.color.art.ros.png!

      The young farmers now emerging onto the land seek to reclaim, restore, and resettle the deserted rural towns of America. We are similarly poised to  revive the fabric of urban life with markets, gardens, bees, corn patches and waterways. Motivated by a force of intention that cannot be rationalized economically, with lives driven by an instinct for direct action and stewardship that honors the planet, people, and place, we are the allies of every American. Our instincts are emboldened by the mercury shatter of dew on the broccoli plants at dawn, by the roar of pollinators in a flowering crop of buckwheat, and by the river of neighbors streaming through the farm-gate clamoring for "real" tomatoes and happy chickens. The hands of young farmers on the land seek to push forward an agenda of sustainability on a human scale.

      There is much to learn, and there is much, as a culture, that we risk forgetting. We need these bodies, we need their work, we need their food and their protagonism. We need young farmers to succeed and we need that success to be rewarded.

      !/images/GH.FarmTools.b:w.art.brk.png!

      As fledgling farmers and activists within this community, we see these to be some of the key political, economic, and cultural requirements for that success:

      * A hospitable policy environment that prioritizes a next generation of food producers -- not massive corporate subsidies, not cheap imports from across the world  
      * A regulatory framework friendly to smaller producers
      * Affordable credit for capitalization of diversified farms
      * Public-private partnerships to give aspiring farmers better access to farmland
      * University research focused on low-input, resilient, sustainable production
      * Practical, school-based, agricultural training programs (hands in the soil)
      * Reformed land-use proscriptions at the community and state level -- some land and soil should never be developed
      * Incubator farms to rear and train fledgling farmers and an Agricultural Journeymen program to help people navigate the path from aspiring farmer to successful new farmer.
      * Processing infrastructure and facilities for fruits, meats, dairy, etc. at the local scale
      * State-sponsored direct-marketing venues -- covered markets, public markets, and friendly zoning for farmers markets and farm-stands
      * Comprehensive, affordable health insurance for farmers and food-workers
      * Improved state-sponsored nutrition programs for at-risk, elderly and civic establishments.
      * Start-up grants and an expansion of Individual Development Accounts, matched-savings program for qualified young farmers, to afford irrigation, tools, equipment, fencing, land, production infrastructure, etc.
      * A cultural revaluation of farming as an ambitious, worthwhile life-venture, celebrated by family, church, and society
      * Fiscal underwriting of farm-supportive NGOs and programs
      * Songs, dances, parties, and festivals for young farmers in the countryside
      * High-speed internet connectivity in rural places
      * New farmer forums for networking, marketing, resource-sharing, processing, and farmer-to-farmer exchanges
      * Access to locally grown seed and protection from transgenic pollution
      * Fair wages and equal labor rights for all farmworkers, even those with "illegal" status
      * Consumer education about the realities and true cost of food production
      * More consumer/producer alliances such as community supported agriculture and community food cooperatives

      And what is success? Success is an edible future, when local populations are fed by local fields and sensible nutrition is affordable and accessible. Where we address poverty and hunger, not with biotechnology, but with long-term access to the means of production, and with proximity to that productive plenty which we can achieve only with careful stewardship of our soil and land base -- a wealth immeasurable in dollars. Success is a smooth energy transition, a satisfying daily bread, a culture in which we have restored honor, and respect to the profession of farming.

      *Call to arms*

      Arms strong and hands calloused, eyes open to the beauty of every morning. Our spirits are prepared for the long row still to hoe, our hearts full with the support of family and community. Let us unite, young farmers! Let us fight for the right to farmable land!  To the pursuit of an equitable marketplace, and for recognition from society. We are here, we are indispensable, we are a cornerstone of the future of food. Let us welcome many new entrants into agriculture, striving to share our lessons, seeds and stories with generations to come. Now is the time for action.

     !/images/labels/why_we_like_maps.png(Why we like maps)!

      Maps are useful. Useful in building empires, yes--but also useful in retrofitting empires. Our landscape is scarred by the boundaries, sacrifice zones, dreams and drainages of American empire. Whether you live in the East, with its abandoned hydro-powered industrial infrastructure, or in the west with mega-dams and irrigated Eden, or in the midwest, with over-pumped aquifers and plastic tilings riddling the water table - it is clear that the legacies of past land use figure deeply into our plans for the future. The future that we are moving towards, that we are ourselves crafting with our physical work, and with our thoughtful engagement- that future cannot be contained only in the vessels+grid constructed in the last centuries. The future that we are building, the local food systems, the energy conservation systems, the sensible transport systems- these systems are a cooperative re-design of the whole social matrix. Overlaid on the map of the past, is a map for the future.

      Here we've linked to maps of cell phone reception, Amtrak rights of way,  oil pipe lines, rivers, national forests, native american reservation lands, highways, soil types, population densities, sheep migration patterns, land ownership statistics etc.   Like the early pioneers, whose settlements were shaped by hospitable valleys and favorable harbors or the industrial towns, perched on railway-intersections, cattle shipment yards, coal deposits- the work of future farmers is to use the mapped topography of America not as a constraint, but as a tool of transparency, enabling imagination. Look at the maps to see the whole picture, the livers and kidneys of our economy, the large intestines of waste disposal, the capilaries of riversystems+ bike trails. Flying over the country you'll see the irrigated crop circles, on a train you see the strip-mines, from a bike you can often perceive the movement of sewage beneath the city. Observing the situation as it is, as it exists, with all the limitations and toxicities--we can suss out opportunities unseen from the mass media screen, we can reject the proscriptions of green-marketeers, profiteers and corporate carpetbaggers. We have sattelite imagery to check out what our neighbors are doing, and to find the patch of greenspace that is our future farm.

      !/images/labels/what_is_the_power_of_information.png(What is the power of information?)!
      
      This project grew out of the question _"So, this young farmers movement, how do you know it exists?"_
      
      Empirically, we've all seen the many many rosy-cheeked babies and young families at farming conferences, we all know that many of our college friends are farming, and that city gardening and Michael Pollan reading are at an all time high. But the American psyche, the American media, and the American political system needs compelling statistics, not just compelling stories. Or anyway so we've been told.
      
      The USDA agricultural census is another critical place to report on your experience as a young or beginning farmer, and we urge you to "click over there":https://www.agcounts.usda.gov/cgi-bin/counts and add your name to the contact list for the next census.
      
      The information from that census is used by researchers, foundations, advocates and policy-makers to shape the rules of agriculture, the state programs, the grants, the research- basically the whole support network.
      
      Historically there has been an undercount of young farmers, small farmers, women farmers, latino farmers and new immigrants. The census people are trying hard, in their dorky pamphlet distributing way, to fix those problems, but we can be pro-active registrants by simply visiting their site, and signing up to get the census in the mail. Be counted!
      
      !/images/labels/the_survey_data_is_useful_in_a_number_of_ways.png(The survey data is useful in a number of ways)!
      
      Firstly, it allows us to know your names and locations across the country, to have a head-count of soil-fertility activists and a database for information sharing.
      
      Second, it shows the public how many of us there are, and allows restauranteurs, natural food stores and committed eaters to reach out to young farmers in their local communities.
      
      Third, the data that you enter in the survey gives us the capacity to predict the economic development potential of new farmers entering a community. We serve the country food, but we also preserve the countryside, provide good healthy jobs, bring an infusion of business into the local agricultural economy, and enhance our watershed with conservation practices. The questions about seed saving, water conservation practices, CSA management etc also provide us with the numbers to show young farmer's contributions to regional food security and the biological intergrity of our stewardship.
      
      !/images/labels/how_will_this_information_be_regurgitated.png(How will this information be regurgitated?)!
      
      The strategic plan for Serve Your Country Food, calls for us to release data from the survey starting as early as January 2009.
      
      That way, the future young president of America, can hear directly from the future young farmers of America. The question becomes..  How can we shift the economic climate, the political climate and the land-use climate for the benefit of local agriculture and its practitioners? Can we shift the focus of our subsidy system away from commodity over-abundance and towards regional self-reliance, local food access, small farm capitalization, and sustainable ag. research? Could we, perhaps, ask for policy that reflects the reality of diabetes, sprawl, rural poverty and crooked planning boards?
      
      !/images/GH.EggBasket.b:w.art.brk.png!

      !/images/labels/what_are_the_red_dots.png(What are the red dots?)!
      
      Many young farmers are still landless nomads working for a few months or years either as apprentices, seasonal farm-workers, tenants or land stewards. Usually this 'journeyman' period provides the skillset and management experience that beginning farmers need to start their own operations. The nomad feature allows such farmers to map their movements around the country and watch an animation of their perambulations. Taken in sum, the combined animation of hundreds of apprentices will dance across the map like some kind of crazy homeless honeybee dance- a great kinetic diorama of the 'farmers in waiting' - critical reminder that land ownership must become accessible to new farmers.
      
      !/images/labels/your_feedback_is_welcome.png(Your feedback is welcome!)!
      
      This site is still in development, and the survey is just the beginning of Serve Your Country Food. If you have some insight about how we might further enhance the site's functionality, or want to collaborate in organizing young-farmer oriented programming at conferences or agricultural trade shows around the country, or want to join the web-design team in some capacity. Please be in touch with us at thegreenhorns@gmail.com.  Also, bring on the constructive criticism!
      
      !/images/labels/what_does_this_data_do.png(What does this data do?)!
      
      The data you enter will be deployed by Serve Your Country food to demonstrate the fierce commitment of young farmers to their soil health, community health, and national food security. These data will help us prove to the public, and to the president how valuable and laudable is the producer, how praise-worthy!
      
      Once you fill in the survey we'll be able to release reports that say .. 1/3 of our 5,000 surveyed young farmers report that they had to 'borrow, beg or steal' the land that the cultivate. That 1/8th of respondants studied environmental science at the college level. That 2/3 of current farm operators started with an apprenticeship.
      
      We'll also use it to generate suggestions of how that president, and that congress over there in Washington might better provide a hospitable environment for new entrants into agriculture while also preserving the existing agricultural economy from financial ruin and  creeping transgenic monocultures.
      
      We seek to promote lively+ resilient farming communities. Use those big boxes for descriptive explanations of your obstacles. Type type type, its can be therapeutic.
      
      !/images/labels/what_do_you_mean_by_visualization_tools.png(What do you mean by visualization tools?)!
      
      One major obstacle for the American public psyche is the clutter on the side of the highway loudly proclaiming its inevitibility. We are hemmed in by loud-mouthed con-men hawking burgers and burritos. Oh, also the highway sans bike-path--that is another problem.
      
      !/images/GH.FermentJars.b:w.art.brk.png!

      !/images/labels/talking_to_the_press.png(Talking to the press)!
      
      So, you've filled out the survey, and you ticked the box that makes your mini-profile available to the press. Great! We added that function because we got so many calls from journalists looking for great young farmers to talk to. Now, hopefully, they'll just get in touch with you directly.
      
      There are some things to keep in mind when you are talking to the press.
      
      1. Speak slowly and clearly
      2. Don't gossip, gripe or undermine your local allies (duh)
      3. Think hard about the 3 main points you want to get across
      
      If you are inviting investment, expansion or partnership use the opportunity that the microphone provides you. If you can, make the story move forward--Promote, don't gloat.
      
      For example
      
      "We are thrilled to be farming here in Tucson and want to expand our sales to some of the fancy restaurants. We are so thankful to our customers for our success thus far"
      
      "The area where we farm was once rat-infested and run down, now 3 of our neighbors have installed edible gardens and our volunteership program is up to 34 members with 65 active composters. We are thankful to city hall for their support and look forward to the new pilot project they are planning in the municipal park."
      
      "Its been difficult for us to raise the cash to afford our small farm. We didn't want to go into debt to buy land and were privileged with an education that allowed us to save money in other professions. It was hard at first, working two jobs, but we're financially solvent now after three years" ( or whatever is the truth, don't lie!)
      
      Basically, be transparent about the obstacles, but don't whine. Be up front about the work. And be prepared for a surge in interest after the article runs--try to use that interest to promote an event or work-day.
      
      4. If a reporter calls, make yourself accessible with email and cell phone. Ask them for their dead-line and be descriptive about photo opportunities  on your farm.
      
      !/images/text/local_food.png!
      
      Our motive with the press-release is to help journalists gain access to your story. They are out hunting for juicy photo-ops, back-roads rock stars and real stories about real Americans working to heal this land. Your story, your struggle and the drama of your greenhouse collapse, these are compelling features for local reporters. Ultimately, the success of young farmer relies to a certain extent on market demand, if we can compellingly articulate the benefits of supporting local ag, and particularly next-generation ag--so much the better for farmers market sales and CSA subscriptions. Cultivate a relationship with your local media as well as community and they will help turn folks out for your harvest festival and raise money when your barn collapses*. And if the demand swells, so to can the supply, and the opportunities for other young farmers to get growing. * Joel Salatin says so in his classic book, You Can Farm.

      Why are we doing this project? What is our intention? Why young farmers?
      
      We are working on the social promotion of young farmers because we mostly are young farmers on the Greenhorns team. We recognize that we are the inheritors of a system in crisis.
