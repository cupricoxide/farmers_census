- We want to be able to email the admin when the survey submitted so that they don't have to login
to check the site all the time ... 

- in the stages_controller the done action is the appropriate place to kick off the emailing process

- we are going to use GMAIL as our SMTP server so we will need some sort of plugin that enhances action_mailer to support TLS 

- in the SagesController#done we can call AdminMailer like so:
	AdminMailer.deliver_done_survey(current_survey, request.host_with_port)

                                          
- We will need some place to store the Admin information... perhaps config/admin.yml 
but for now I've put it in app/models/admin.rb

need ./lib/smtp_tls.rb
